# RingBuffer Challenge
> Requirements:
> - Initialize a ring buffer.
> - Implement `.push(item)`
> - Implement `.pop`

## Installation
```shell
git clone git@github.com:AudTheCodeWitch/ringbuffer.git
cd ringbuffer
```

## Usage
1. Run `bundle install`
2. Run the tests with `rspec`

## Aud's Notes
The ring buffer was a totally new data structure to me! [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer) has a
decent run-down of how it works. The graphics are especially helpful for envisioning how a linear object (array) could 
be configured in a circular manner.

This exercise was completed using TDD and was a first pass. I'm confident a code review with my peers would reveal
several opportunities for improvement.

## Potential Next Steps
1. Solicit feedback/code reviews and implement changes
2. Explore potential edge cases
3. Update documentation
4. Package as a gem!
